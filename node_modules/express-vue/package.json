Then this is the library for you.\n\nThe idea is simple use Node+Express for your Controller and Models, and Vue.js for your Views.. you can have a secure server side rendered website without all the hassle. Your Controller will pass in the data to your View through\n\n`res.renderVue('view', {data}, [{vueOptions}])`.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Requirements](#requirements)\n    - [ES Modules](#es-modules)\n- [Example / Starter](#example--starter)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n    - [Options](#options)\n        - [VueVersion](#vueversion)\n    - [Components / Mixins / Etc](#components--mixins--etc)\n    - [CSS Inside Components/Views](#css-inside-componentsviews)\n    - [Mixins](#mixins)\n    - [Meta](#meta)\n        - [Structured Data](#structured-data)\n    - [Template](#template)\n- [Vue Dev Tools](#devtools)\n- [Caching](#caching)\n- [Finally](#finally)\n- [Typescript Support](#typescript-support)\n- [SailsJS Support](#sailsjs-support)\n- [Migration to Webpack Renderer](#migration-to-webpack-renderer)\n- [V5 Migration](#v5-migration)\n- [Changelog](#changelog)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save express-vue\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nRequires Node V6 or greater, and Vue 2.0 or greater. (Latest Vue.js is included in this project)\n\n### ES Modules\n\nIf using ES module statments like\n\n```js\nexport default {}\n//or\nimport foo from \"foo\";\n```\n\nOr any other ES features you will need to also install `babel-core` and `babel-preset-env`.\n\n```sh\nnpm i -D babel-core babel-preset-env\n```\n\nThen place a `.babelrc` file in your root. here's an example targeting last two versions\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\"env\", {\n      \"targets\": {\n        \"browsers\": [\"last 2 versions\"]\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Example / Starter\n\nAn example / starter can be found [here](https://github.com/express-vue/express-vue-mvc-starter)\n\n## Usage\n\nThis is the minimum required setup.\nIf you don't provide a `vueVersion` it will use the latest one when the project was published.\nIf there is no `rootPath` it will assume the root is the parent directory of `node_modules`.\n\n```js\nvar expressVue = require(\"express-vue\");\nvar app = express();\n\n//pass your app through express-vue here\n//expressVueOptions is optional and explained later in the docs\n//this is a promise, so you can either await it or do this.\nexpressVue.use(app, expressVueOptions).then(() => {\n    //the rest of your express routes.\n});\n```\n\nIn your route, assuming you have a main.vue\n\n```js\nrouter.get('/', (req, res, next) => {\n    const data: {\n        otherData: 'Something Else'\n    };\n    req.vueOptions: {\n        head: {\n            title: 'Page Title',\n            metas: [\n                { property:'og:title', content: 'Page Title'},\n                { name:'twitter:title', content: 'Page Title'},\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    res.renderVue('main.vue', data, req.vueOptions);\n})\n```\n\nTo use Data binding into the vue files you need to pass data in through the `data` object as above.\nexpress-vue will automatically add anything you put here to the root element of your Vue components.\nYou do not need to have anything in data in your .vue file, but if you did what you put in res.render\nwill overwrite it.\n\n### Remember to always write your data objects in your .vue files as functions!\n\n## Options\n\n|key|type|description|required?|default value|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|rootPath|string|this is the path the library will use as the base for all lookups| optional| the directory that your `../node_modules` lives in|\n|vueVersion|string or object|this is where you specify which version of vue.js's library to use from the CDN | optional| the latest version as of publishing this|\n|layout|Object|this is the object for customzing the html, body, and template tags| optional| has default value which is in the example below|\n|vue|Object|this is the global config for vue for example you can set a global title, or a script tag in your head block everything here is global|optional|no default value|\n|data|Object|this is the global data object, this will be merged in to your .vue file's data block on every route, you can override this per route.|optional|no default value|\n\nHere's an example, with the default layout config included for you to see...\n\n```js\nconst vueOptions = {\n    rootPath: path.join(__dirname, '../example/views'),\n    head: {\n        title: 'Hello this is a global title',\n        scripts: [\n            { src: 'https://example.com/script.js' },\n        ],\n        styles: [\n            { style: '/assets/rendered/style.css' }\n        ]\n    },\n    data: {\n        foo: true,\n        bar: 'yes',\n        qux: {\n            id: 123,\n            baz: 'anything you wish, you can have any kind of object in the data object, it will be global and on every route'\n        }\n    }\n};\nexpressVue.use(app, vueOptions);\n```\n\n## Components / Mixins / Etc\n\n### NOTE: Components and Mixins need to be OUTSIDE of the Pages Root folder.\n\nWhen including components/mixins/etc the directory it looks is going to be relative to the file you're working in currently.\nassuming the below is running in a folder with a subdirectory `components` and a directory `mixins` in a parent, it would look like this.\nwhen importing .vue files and .js files from node modules you can just import them the normal way you import a module.\n\n```html\n<script>\nimport messageComp from './components/message-comp.vue';\nimport users from './components/users.vue';\nimport exampleMixin from '../mixins/exampleMixin';\nimport externalComponent from 'foo/bar/external.vue';\nexport default {\n    mixins: [exampleMixin],\n    data: function () {\n        return {\n        }\n    },\n    components: {\n        messageComp,\n        users,\n        externalComponent\n    }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n## CSS inside components/views\n\nPlease use regular CSS for now, SCSS/LESS/etc are compiled languages, and this is a runtime library for now.\nIn the future I will be creating build tools to handle compiling the .vue files into .js files so that it runs faster,\nand more efficient at runtime. But for dev mode, it will compile everything at runtime, so you can edit and preview faster.\n\n```html\n<style>\n    .test {\n        border: 2px;\n    }\n    .test a {\n        color: #FFF;\n    }\n</style>\n```\n\n## Mixins\n\nYou can now use Mixins, lets say you have an file called `exampleMixin.js` and it looks like this:\n\n`examplemixin.js`\n```js\nmodule.exports {\n    methods: {\n        hello: function () {\n            console.log('Hello');\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn your route you would declare it by placing `mixins: [exampleMixin]` in your vue object.\n\n```html\n<script>\nimport exampleMixin from '../mixins/exampleMixin';\nexport default {\n    mixins: [exampleMixin],\n    data: function () {\n        return {\n        }\n    }\n}\n</script>\n```\nYou can now use this in your .Vue file, like so\n\n```html\n<button @click=\"hello()\">Click me and look at console logs</button>\n```\n\n## Meta\n\nThis library takes the wonderful inspiration from [vue-head](https://github.com/ktquez/vue-head) and adapts it to\nwork here. Just add a `meta` array into your `head` object, with support for both `content` and `property` types.\n(Note we don't support shorthand here, and no support for google+ just yet, that will come soon).\n\n```js\nconst vueOptions = {\n    head: {\n        title: 'It will be a pleasure',\n        // Meta tags\n        metas: [\n            { name: 'application-name', content: 'Name of my application' },\n            { name: 'description', content: 'A description of the page', id: 'desc' } // id to replace intead of create element\n            // ...\n            // Twitter\n            { name: 'twitter:title', content: 'Content Title' },\n            // ...\n            // Facebook / Open Graph\n            { property: 'fb:app_id', content: '123456789' },\n            { property: 'og:title', content: 'Content Title' },\n            // ...\n            // Rel\n            { rel: 'icon', type: 'image/png', href: '/assets/favicons/favicon-32x32.png', sizes: '32x32' }\n            // Generic rel for things like icons and stuff\n        ],\n        // Scripts\n        scripts:[\n            { src: '/assets/scripts/hammer.min.js' },\n            { src: '/assets/scripts/vue-touch.min.js', charset: 'utf-8' },\n            // Note with Scripts [charset] is optional defaults to utf-8\n            // ...\n        ],\n        // Styles\n        styles: [\n            { style: '/assets/rendered/style.css' }\n            { style: '/assets/rendered/style.css', type: 'text/css' }\n            // Note with Styles, [type] is optional...\n            // ...\n        ],\n    }\n}\nexpressVue.use(app, vueOptions);\n```\n\n## Structured Data\n\nThis also supports Google Structured data\nhttps://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data\n\n\n```js\nconst vueOptions = {\n    head: {\n        title: 'It will be a pleasure',\n        structuredData: {\n            \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"url\": \"http://www.your-company-site.com\",\n            \"contactPoint\": [{\n                \"@type\": \"ContactPoint\",\n                \"telephone\": \"+1-401-555-1212\",\n                \"contactType\": \"customer service\"\n            }]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n## Template\n\nIf you want to have a custom layout you can, here is the default layout, each part is overridable.\n\n```js\nconst vueOptions = {\n    //...\n    template: {\n        html: {\n            start: '<!DOCTYPE html><html>',\n            end: '</html>'\n        },\n        body: {\n            start: '<body>',\n            end: '</body>'\n        }\n        template: {\n            start: '<div id=\"app\">',\n            end: '</div>'\n        }\n    }\n    //...\n};\nexpressVue.use(app, vueOptions);\n```\n\n\n## DevTools\n\nTo use the amazing Vue.js DevTools please set the environment variable `VUE_DEV=true`this will also trigger the development version of vue to be included in the head.\n\n## Caching\n\nCaching is now enabled by default, in dev mode hopefuly you're using something like nodemon/gulp/grunt etc, which restarts the server on file change.. otherwise you will need to stop and restart the server if you change your files.. which is normal.\n\n## Typescript support\n\nTypescript declarations are published on NPM, so you don’t need external tools like Typings, as declarations are automatically imported with express-vue. That means all you need is a simple:\n\n```js\nimport expressVue = require('express-vue');\n```\n\n## Sailsjs Support\n\nThis is middleware now so support for sails should just work as middleware.\n\n## Migration to Webpack Renderer\n\n- change `rootPath` to `pagesPath`\n- remove `vueVersion`\n- install `webpack` `vue-loader` and `css-loader`\n- remove `.babelrc` if you have one\n- if you're using regular babel packages switch to the `@babel` versions `@babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-es2015`\n- remove vuejs\n- move your expressVue options into a file on the root of your directory (same level as node_modules) and call it `expressvue.config.js`\n- Use the new init syntax `expressVue.use(expressApp);` this is a async function, so please either await it or use it in a promise.\n\n\n## V5 Migration\n\n- Ditched the custom parser/renderer and moved to using `vue-pronto` which uses `Vueify`\n- Re-structured the vueOptions\n- Added `req.vueOptions` as a global.\n- Removed the vue parent object with the child of head, this was un-needed its now just `vueOptions.head` instead of `vueOptions.vue.head`\n- When using `res.renderVue` the filename requires an extention now.\n- Paths are now RELATIVE to the file you're currently in ... YAAAY\n- Node Modules are supported, for both javascript and vue file imports inside .vue files ... YAAAY\n- Massive Performance gains\n- 100% compatability with vueJS\n- Migration to Vue-Pronto\n\nExpress-vue-renderer got too heavy, the architecture became too messy, and it was slow. It needed to get thrown out. Enter vue-pronto it uses vueify under the hood, and is much more modular. this will be much easier going forward to maintain.\n\n### Changes to the Vue Options Object\n\nThere's been some big changes to this object, so before it would look like this\n\n```js\nconst vueOptions = {\n    vue: {\n        head: {\n            meta: [\n                { script: 'https://unpkg.com/vue@2.4.2/dist/vue.js'},\n                { name: 'application-name', content: 'Name of my application' },\n                { name: 'description', content: 'A description of the page', id: 'desc' },\n                { style: '/assets/style.css' }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n### Now its different ..\n\n- We have automated getting vueJS from the CDN for you, and which version (dev/prod) it should use based on the environment variable `VUE_DEV`.\n- We also broke up the meta object, into metas, scripts, and styles arrays.\nscripts now have scriptSrc which is a string including the <script> elements which will be placed in your head as is.\n- The parent vue object that wraps the head object was unneeded and removed.\nhere's the same as above but newer\n\n```js\nconst vueOptions = {\n    vueOptions: \"2.4.2\",\n    head: {\n        metas: [\n            { name: 'application-name', content: 'Name of my application' },\n            { name: 'description', content: 'A description of the page', id: 'desc' },\n        ],\n        styles: [\n            { style: '/assets/style.css' }\n        ]\n    }\n};\n```\n### Vue File changes\n\nRoutes before were relative to the `rootPath`... now that is gone... routes for requires are relative to the file you are currently in.\nAlso `node_module` paths are working for both .js and .vue includes\n\n### Remember to look at this if you're getting errors!\n\n**`res.renderVue` Changes**\n\n`res.renderVue` now requires an extension for the file you're using in the route. `foo/bar` now `foo/bar.vue`\n\n### New\n\nGlobal `req.vueOptions`. this is super handy for passing options around between middleware.\n\n## Changelog\n\n#### V5\n- Ditched the custom parser/renderer and moved to using `vue-pronto` which uses Vueify\n- Re-structured the vueOptions\n- Added req.vueOptions as a global.\n- Removed the vue parent object with the child of head, this was un-needed its now just vueOptions.head instead of vueOptions.vue.head\n- when using `res.renderVue` the filename requires an extention now.\n- Paths are now RELATIVE to the file you're currently in ... YAAAY\n- Node Modules are supported, for both javascript and vue file imports inside .vue files ... YAAAY\n- Massive Performance gains\n- 100% compatability with vueJS\n\n#### V4\n- v4 was a complete re-write.. migrating from v3 to v4 will break everything.\n- No longer is res.render used, its now res.renderVue\n- Now replies with streams instead of a single sync call\n- massive performance increase\n- import vue components in your vue files!\n- lots of other changes\n\n#### V3\n- v3 has seriously changed the object you pass into the vue file.. so please if migrating from\nan earlier version (and you should). Take the time to look at the new object. Sorry for the breaking change, but I'm only one person.\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0 © [Daniel Cherubini](https://cherubini.casa)\n\n\n[daviddm-image]: https://david-dm.org/express-vue/express-vue.svg?theme=shields.io\n[daviddm-url]: https://david-dm.org/express-vue/express-vue\n[coveralls-image]: https://coveralls.io/repos/express-vue/express-vue/badge.svg\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/express-vue/express-vue\n",
